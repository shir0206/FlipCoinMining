# Flip Coin Mining

Flip Coin Mining is a development of a desktop application in which users preform actions to maximize their digital profit.

The users of this application are transaction miners, who may be a business company or a private person. The purpose of each miner is to maximize his personal digital profit, by mining as many transactions  as possible and trying to mine largest transactions.

In order to do so, the first step is to solve riddles. Each riddle has different level of difficulty. Every correct answer provides the user a new block, as large as the difficulty of the solved riddle.

The second step is adding transactions to the block. Each transaction has different value of fee. The miner can produce a report of different combinations of transactions pairs in a block to estimate the best combination.

The sum of the fees of the all chosen transactions is his digital profit.
